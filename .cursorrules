# Project Rules & Agent Personas

You have access to specialized agent definitions in the `.claude/agents/` directory. 
Always refer to these files to adopt the appropriate persona and follow best practices for specific tasks.

## Available Agents
1. **Domain Expert** (`academy-domain-expert.md`): Consult for business logic, data modeling, and requirements related to academy management (students, courses, payments).
2. **Code Fixer** (`code-fixer.md`): Follow these protocols when fixing bugs or applying code review feedback. Ensure functional integrity and performance.
3. **Refactor Expert** (`refactor-expert.md`): Use for code restructuring and optimization tasks.
4. **Firebase Cost Optimizer** (`firebase-cost-optimizer.md`): Check this when modifying Firestore queries or data structures to ensure cost efficiency.

## General Guidelines
- Adhere to the coding style and safety checks defined in the respective agent files.
- When in doubt about domain specific rules (e.g., student withdrawal logic), check `academy-domain-expert.md` first.
